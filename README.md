A very very basic transcription program with a start / stop button using vosk as it appears to be the only model we can run with the tablet's hardware capabilities (the move accurate ones seem to need cuda stuff)
Will become more fleshed-out, but probably only after the hackathon's over. 
If someone figures out how to use whisper.cpp instead of vosk that would drastically improve accuracy but I have been trying to do that for a while and it hasn't worked (could just be me being an idiot though).
